It enables efficient handling of doctors, nurses, and patients while providing functionalities for adding, deleting, and editing records.

2. Objectives
Staff Management: Efficiently manage doctors and nurses, including their details, roles, and assignments.
Patient Management: Register patients, track their information, and manage their treatment needs.
User Access Control: Secure access to staff management features via password protection.
Information Display: Provide comprehensive details of staff and patients as needed.

4. Key Features
Staff Management:
Add, delete, and edit doctors and nurses.
Store and display staff details, including specialization and assigned shifts.

5. Patient Management:
Register new patients and track their medical history.
Update patient details as necessary.
Assign doctors to patients based on their specialization.
Password Protection: Staff management features are secured with a password to prevent unauthorized access.
Data Storage: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation to manage data for staff and patients.

6. Technical Architecture
Programming Language: C++.
Object-Oriented Design: The system is structured using classes such as Person, Staff, Doctor, Nurse, and Patient to encapsulate data and functionalities.
Dynamic Memory Management: Utilizes new and delete for memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring proper memory management.

7. Class Structure
Person: Base class representing a person with attributes like name, age, and gender.
Staff: Inherits from Person, adding staff-specific attributes like staff ID and salary.
Doctor and Nurse: Derived classes from Staff, each with specialized attributes (e.g., specialization for doctors).
Patient: Inherits from Person, with additional attributes for medical conditions and patient ID.
HospitalManagementSystem: Central class that manages the operations, including storing arrays of doctors, nurses, and patients.

8. Implementation
Default Data: The system initializes with some default doctors, nurses, and patients for demonstration purposes.
User Interaction: A text-based menu system allows users to navigate through different functionalities easily.

9. User Experience
The application provides a simple command-line interface for managing hospital staff and patients.
Users can navigate through various options to perform tasks like adding or removing staff and patients.

10. Future Enhancements
Database Integration: Implement persistent data storage using a database for scalability and data integrity.
User Interface Improvements: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
Enhanced Security: Incorporate user roles and permissions for more granular access control.
Additional Features: Include appointment scheduling and billing functionalities for comprehensive management.
